# Vim Pandoc Wiki

I think that the vim-pandoc project is done really well, but I missed some of the functions provided by vimwiki.
For a while I tried making them both work together, but it seemed like too much bloat to have two separate plugins that wanted to do all of the heavy lifting involved in managing markdown.

## Installation

`Plug 'j718/vim-pandoc-wiki'`

## Usage

`:h pandoc-wiki`
